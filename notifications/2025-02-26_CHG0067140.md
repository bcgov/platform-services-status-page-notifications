Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0067140 Standard Change 049 - Hosting - Shutdown server for Decommission

Migrating Gold DR app nodes from Virtual to Physical

**When?**

Starting Wednesday Feb 26th at 9am and completing before 5pm

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

All app pods will be drained and re-scheduled to new nodes.

The new physical nodes will be added to the cluster and made schedulable for new pods. The old nodes will then be marked as cordoned. We will then drain one node at a time to move its workloads to the new physical nodes. Once all workloads are moved the old nodes will be shut down and removed from the cluster.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
