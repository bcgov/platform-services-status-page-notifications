Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0068976 STMS NET - Controlled reboots of ToR switches to generate traffic through IPS

In the Kamloops Data Center, Network wants to test a Top of Rack (ToR) switch fail-over to confirm a previous incident does not repeat itself. To mitigate risk, the IPS devices will be temporarily configured into a failed-open state during this change.

**When?**

Starting at Sunday, June 8, 2025 at 2:00AM and completing by 4:50AM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Open network connections for SILVER, GOLD or EMERALD may need to be re-established after the switch fail-overs take place.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
