Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0069227 CITZ - GOLDDR MCS - Apply latest firmware to masters and infra servers

**When?**

Starting at Tuesday, May 20 9:00 AM and finishing before Friday May 23 at 5:00 PM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Only the masters and infra nodes will be drained and restarted, no impact to running pods.

There may be short periods where the calls to the API server timeout as it fails over between master nodes.

There may be short periods where web traffic requests are disconnected as it fails over between infra nodes.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
