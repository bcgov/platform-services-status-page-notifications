Hi @all, your attention is needed!

**What is happening?**

CHG0072263 HS INFRA - VMware NSX updates address multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-22243, CVE-2025-22244, CVE-2025-22245) - Platform Global Managers

The VMWare team will be applying security patches to the NSX infrastructure responsible for connectivity to both the Openshift KLAB2 and EMERALD clusters.

**When?**

Starting at Thursday, September 25th 2025 at 7:00 PM and finishing before 11:30 PM the same evening.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

User workloads should not be impacted since the Virtual Machines (VMs) hosting workloads will be Vmotioned while live between ESXi hosts, but it is possible some open network connections may be reset and need to be re-established as part of this maintenance.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
