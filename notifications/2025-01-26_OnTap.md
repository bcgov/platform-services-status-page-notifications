Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0065838 - MCS - NetApp Storage Cluster CDOT OS Upgrade - SILVER
CHG0065839 - MCS - NetApp Storage Cluster CDOT OS Upgrade - GOLD
CHG0065840 - MCS - NetApp Storage Cluster CDOT OS Upgrade - GOLDDR

These changes will update the software on the NetApp storage appliances use for Persistent Volumes.

**When?**

Starting at 7:00 AM PST and finishing by 12:00 PM

Silver on Sunday January 26th
Gold on Sunday February 9th
Gold DR on Sunday February 23rd

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No, no downtime is expected at the time, for questions post in #devops-operations

During the upgrade, starting pods with `netapp-block-standard` volumes may take up to 10 minutes as only one node is available and Trident takes a while to timeout. Running pods should not be impacted.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
