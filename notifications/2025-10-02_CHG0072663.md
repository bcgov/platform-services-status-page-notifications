Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0072663 HS Infra - BCGov SDN - Reconfigure MCS Emerald Tier 0 routers to peer with the datacenter WAN routers

The VMWare and Network teams will be working together to reconfigure the software-based NSX router for the EMERALD cluster. This has been done successfully already with the KLAB2 cluster.

**When?**

Starting 7:00PM PDT on October 2nd 2025 and concluding before 9:00PM the same evening.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No impact expected for running pods or services.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
