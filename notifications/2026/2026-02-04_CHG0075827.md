Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0075827 - CITZ - MCS GOLDDR - Drain nodes after a successful NetApp migration

Drain and reboot the worker and infra nodes to ensure 100% consistency and redundancy after last weekend's NetApp hardware replacement change.

**When?**

Starting at Wednesday Feb 4th 2026 at 9:00 AM and finishing before Feb 5th at 5:00 PM.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Running pods will be drained onto other nodes through the change so applications should be monitored.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Monitor your apps that rely on the API during the change.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
