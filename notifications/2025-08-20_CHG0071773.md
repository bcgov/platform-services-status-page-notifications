Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

Removing 6 nodes from the cluster to be replaced by new hardware in a later CHG.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Pods will be restarted onto other nodes.

Nodes to be shut down:

- mcs-silver-app-07.dmz
- mcs-silver-app-08.dmz

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
