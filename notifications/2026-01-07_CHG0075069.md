Hi @all, your attention is needed!

**What is happening?**

CHG0075069 - CITZ - MCS GOLD - Drain and decommission two worker nodes

Two worker nodes in the GOLD cluster will be drained for decommissioning as part of a project to refresh the end of life hardware.

**When?**

Starting January 7th after 9am and completing before 3pm the same day.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Individual workloads associated with applications will be drained onto other nodes as part of this change.

**Do I need to do anything?**

Monitor your applications for disruptions. Well designed applications should be able to tolerate the pod restarts without issue.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
