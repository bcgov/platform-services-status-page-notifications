Hi @all, your attention is needed!

**What is happening?**

CHG0074794 CITZ MCS GOLDDR - Upgrade Trident to 25.10
CHG0074830 CITZ MCS GOLD - Upgrade Trident to 25.10
CHG0074831 CITZ MCS SILVER - Upgrade Trident to 25.10

Upgrade Trident, the interface between OpenShift and the storage on the NetApp

**When?**

Starting at 6am on Sunday and finishing by 9am

- Gold DR Jan 11th
- Gold Jan 18th
- Silver Jan 25th

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

During the upgrade, changes to storage will not be processed. This includes creation and deletion of PVCs, or unmounting and mounting of PVCs when pods start or stop. Once the upgrade is completed any pending changes will be processed.

Running pods that already have storage mounted are not expected to be impacted.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
