Hi @all, your attention is needed!

**What is happening?**

CHG0073933 CITZ MCS EMERALD - Drain App 01 and add GPUs

Adding a NVidia GPU to one of the Emerald app nodes.

**When?**

Starting at Thursday, Nov 13 at 9:00 AM and finishing before Friday at 5pm

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

One app node will be drained and any pods running on it will be moved to other nodes.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
