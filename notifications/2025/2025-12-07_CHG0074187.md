Hi @all, your attention is needed!

**What is happening?**

CHG0074187 CITZ MCS SILVER - Enable Wildcard Routes

We will be enabling wildcard routes for a specific team. This will cause a rolling restart of the HAProxy router pods.

**When?**

Starting at Sunday, Dec 7 at 6:00 AM and finishing before 9:00 AM

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No, no downtime is expected at the time, for questions post in #devops-operations

Long running connections may be reset as they fail over to other router pods

**Do I need to do anything?**

No

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
