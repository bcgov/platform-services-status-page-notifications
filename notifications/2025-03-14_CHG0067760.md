Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0067760 - CITZ - SILVER - Drain and reboot a worker node before a scheduled NetApp RFC

We want to drain a single SILVER worker node (MCS-SILVER-APP-36.DMZ) before a scheduled RFC for upgrading the NetApp appliance is ran to ensure the node in question does not cause issues during the NetApp RFC.

**When?**

Starting after 9:00AM PT on Friday March 14th 2025 for the VMWare work. The work will conclude before 4:00PM the same day.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

Workloads for a single node will be affected, thus should not affect applications configured with High Availablity in mind.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
