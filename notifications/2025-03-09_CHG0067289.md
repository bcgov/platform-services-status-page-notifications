Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0067289 CITZ MCS SILVER - Adjust HAProxy hard-stop setting

Adjust the max time a connection to a route can stay open from 6 hours to 4 hours.

**When?**

Starting at Sunday, March 9th at 6am and finishing before 9am (should only take 15 min)

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

As the Router pods restart, any existing connections to Routes will be closed.

**Do I need to do anything?**

No action required.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
