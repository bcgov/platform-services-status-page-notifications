Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

CHG0068436 STMS NET - CAL & KAM - Equinix Internet Access failover test

<https://ociomysc.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&table=u_kb_template_technical_information_bulletin&sys_id=60a7aa2e3b41aa10709d868c24e45af5&view=ess>

**When?**

Starting at Sunday May 4th at 05:00AM PDT completing before 9:00AM.

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

No, there may be connections that may be dropped during this process and users will have to reconnect. Connectivity between Calgary and Kamloops hosted Openshift clusters may be affected briefly due to the failover process which uses BGP as well as connectivity between Openshift and the Internet for the same reason.


**Do I need to do anything?**

No.

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
