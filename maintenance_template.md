Hi @all, your attention is needed! 

**What is happening?**

RFC XXXXX (if applicable)

[Provide plan language description of the changes and determine audience (Product owners? Developers?) 

**When?**

Starting at [Example: Thursday, April 2 2024 at 6:00 AM PST/PDT] and finishing at [Example: Thursday, April 3 at 9:00 AM PST/PDT]

**Will there be an impact on the Platform apps?**

[Example: Yes, we expect a **30 second interruption to traffic** as the confi is applied to the load balancer **@steven.barre** will be monitoring traffic flows]

or 

[Example: No, no downtime is expected at the time, for questions contact **steven.barre**]

**Do I need to do anything?**

[Yes / No ]

[If yes, describe in plain language the changes required to be made by the **app team and product owner** before **and** after the change]

**Check the #devops-alert channel for the announcement of when the change is complete and check the health of your app.**

**Where do I get help if my app doesn't work after the change is complete?**

Each Platform application has an assigned DevOps Specialist within the Ministry so contact them first. If you don't know who your assigned DevOps Specialist, check with the app's Product Owner.

The DevOps Specialist will troubleshoot the issue with the app and if they need help, they will reach out to the Platform Services Team and the Developer Community in RocketChat as per these [RocketChat Channel Use Guidelines](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/bc-developer-guide/rocketchat/rocketchat-channel-descriptions/).
